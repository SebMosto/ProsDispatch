## 2024-06-03 - Open Redirect Vulnerability in Edge Functions
**Vulnerability:** The Edge Functions `create-checkout-session` and `create-portal-session` blindly trust the `returnUrl` provided by the client, using it as the `success_url`, `cancel_url`, or `return_url`. This allows an attacker to create checkout or portal sessions that redirect victims to malicious sites, potentially to steal session IDs or conduct phishing attacks.
**Learning:** `returnUrl` must always be validated against a whitelist of trusted domains (e.g., the application's base URL) before being used in redirect flows.
**Prevention:** Implement a validation function to ensure the `returnUrl` is relative, or if absolute, matches an allowed domain.

## 2024-06-03 - Hardcoded Secrets Bypassing Environment Variables
**Vulnerability:** The `src/lib/supabase.ts` file had hardcoded `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseAnonKey` strings directly in the source code. While one was marked as a "Temporary Bypass", this completely subverted the environment variable system (`import.meta.env`) and caused secrets to be tracked in version control, creating a critical risk of exposing database credentials.
**Learning:** Developers sometimes hardcode secrets temporarily for local debugging or due to environment issues, and forget to revert them before committing.
**Prevention:** Always ensure configuration files pull secrets exclusively from environment variables.
